7. I suggest you use tools like "perltidy" for code formatting (it's on cpan). my .perltidyrc looks like:
--backup-and-modify-in-place
--backup-file-extension=beforeTidy
--block-brace-tightness=0
--brace-tightness=0
--closing-token-indentation=1
--continuation-indentation=4
--indent-columns=4
--maximum-line-length=195
--nocuddled-else
--noopening-brace-on-new-line
--nooutdent-labels
--paren-tightness=0
--square-bracket-tightness=0
--vertical-tightness=0
--vertical-tightness-closing=0
--break-at-old-comma-breakpoints

13. This is the biggest gripe so far - you defined *A LOT* of global
variables.
Global variables are bad. Lots of global variables is even worse.
Consider using single global variable - hash - for config, and using it
to set values. This works like this:

our %cfg;
die ".." unless GetOptions(
   \%cfg,
   qw(
       host|h=s
       port|p=i
       ...
   )
);

This is of course only example look.
Another approach (one that I like much better) is to use OO perl, and
use $self (object itself) as %cfg.

22. in build_object_lists() you're parsing output of pg_restore -l.
   in the parse code, you assume that object type is always /\S+/,
   which is not true - for example: FK CONSTRAINT
   # Not currently an issue since none of the things I want to match on are multiple words.
   # Constraints are containted in the table dump which uses pg_dump anyway.
   # TODO: Search for any combination of capital letters and spaces? 
   # TODO: Make list of known types and match on them?
